# dxf2svg

A simple program to take a DXF and export it to SVG.
This only deals with 2D drawings and doesn't deal with any styling/layers/etc.
It probably doesn't work for any file that I haven't explicitly tested it on.

This was written to automate the "select and join" step of my OnShape to Illustrator to Glowforge workflow.
